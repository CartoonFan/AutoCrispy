AutoCrispy has some features.  I'll explain them here.

## Files

AutoCrispy will try to detect any Executables it supports on startup.  They can be in the folder with AutoCrispy, or in their own subfolders.  Note that, AutoCrispy only searches one folder deep (that is to say, it doesn't check any folders inside of folders for the Executables).

Autocrispy also searches in these subfolders for Python Scrips and ESRGAN Models.  For ESRGAN Models, AutoCrispy also searches down one level further (So, two directorys down).
